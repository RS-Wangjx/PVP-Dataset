# PVP-Dataset
Photovoltaic Panel (PVP) Dataset was publicly available in paper "[PVNet: A novel semantic segmentation model for extracting high-quality photovoltaic panels in large-scale systems from high-resolution remote sensing imagery]([https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9780164](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569843223001310))" on [International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-applied-earth-observation-and-geoinformation).  

It is a public dataset for extracting high-quality photovoltaic panels in large-scale systems. The PVP Dataset contains 4640 pairs image of PV panel samples from 13 provinces in China. The samples in PVP Dataset were collected by Google Earth, Tianditu and Mapbox.Each group of samples in composed a image of 512×512 pixels and a corresponding label of PV panels.
